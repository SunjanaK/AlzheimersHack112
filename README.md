Aight,

So to run the bottle2.py file, you need to run

python3 bottle2.py \
	--prototxt MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt \
	--model MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel

in your terminal. You also need to have MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt and MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel
in the same folder as you have your bottle2.py
